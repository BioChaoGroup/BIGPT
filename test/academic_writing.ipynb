    "The aim of the present study was to identify genes and pathways that are dysregulated in RVVC. We recruited two independent cohorts of patients with RVVC and healthy controls (NEC, n = 75 patients and n = 98 controls; SEC, n = 85 patients and n = 77 controls). Both cohorts consisted of patients that were positively culture proven in the given medical center at that time point. All groups underwent WES. At the same time, we functionally assessed the control group for their capacity to respond to Candida stimulation in vitro. Genetic variants that we found associated with the disease were overlapped with variants that led to a changed cytokine profile after stimulation with C. albicans, leading to the identification of pathways and genetic variants. Using different in vitro approaches such as cytokine measurements [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)], flow cytometry, and gene silencing (siRNA), we evaluated the role of SIGLEC15 in the host immune response against Candida. All in vitro stimulation experiments were performed at least three times with blood from healthy volunteers and, if stated, with blood from patients with RVVC. Moreover, we designed a vector containing the genetic variant and tested it in an isogenic background. Last, we evaluated specific gene silencing in mice that were intravaginally infected with Candida. Healthy female mice aged 8 to 10 weeks were used throughout the experiments.\n",

    "The inclusion of the North European RVVC cohort and controls took place from January 2009 to December 2013 at the Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) (Nijmegen, Netherlands) and Wayne State University School of Medicine (Detroit, USA). The South European RVVC cohort and controls were recruited at the Santa Maria della Misericordia Hospital (Perugia, Italy), as previously described (37). Inclusion was approved by the institutional review boards of all centers. All patients gave written informed consent, and the study was done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Included patients were diagnosed with at least three documented episodes of VVC in a year with the cause of disease microbiologically confirmed to be C. albicans. Recruitment took place during episodes of acute vaginitis or, if asymptomatic, while receiving maintenance fluconazole therapy. All controls were of European origin, asymptomatic, and without a history of Candida infections. All subjects gave written informed consent.\n",

    "WES of both cohorts was carried out at the Beijing Genome Institute (Beijing, China). Two different enrichment kits were used during the enrichment step: Agilent SureSelect version 2 (NEC) and version 4 (SEC). The genomic DNA samples were randomly fragmented by Covaris, and adapters were ligated to both ends of the resulting fragments. The adaptor-ligated templates were purified by the Agencourt AMPure SPRI beads and fragments with an insert size of about 176 base pairs (bp) were excised. Extracted DNA was amplified, purified, and hybridized to the SureSelect Biotinylated RNA Library (BAITS) for enrichment. The enriched libraries were loaded on a HiSeq 2000 platform for the high-throughput sequencing. Raw image files were processed by Illumina base-calling software 1.7 for base calling with default parameters, and the sequences of each individual were generated as 90-bp pair-end reads.\n",

    "Sequence reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using BWA (0.7.0) (50). Potential PCR duplicates were removed using Picard version 1.84 (http://broadinstitute.github.oi/picard), and reads were locally realigned using the genome analysis toolkit (GATK) “IndelRealigner” tool. The base quality was recalibrated using the GATK “BaseRecalibration.” Both single-nucleotide variants and small insertion/deletions were called using the GATK “UnifiedGenotyper” on the four samples simultaneously (51). All steps were performed in accordance with the GATK version 2.4.9 “Best Practices” (https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) (52, 53). We filtered out all variants with a “quality by depth” lower than 60× and with less than 20× coverage. Variants were annotated using a custom-made pipeline described earlier (54). Annotations include RefSeq gene annotation, amino acid consequences, variants and frequencies from dbSNP135, variants and frequencies from the Radboudumc Human Genetics database, and disease information from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) (55). Samples with non-normal sequencing coverage or non-normal number of called variants were excluded. To calculate the coverage and the number of variants, we used in-house scripts and bedtools version 2.17.0 (56). Variants were not considered in further analyses if they were either marked as failed by the variant calling software [GATK; (51)], had a quality score lower than 50, a coverage depth greater than 200× or lower than 20×, or a variant call that failed in more than 20 samples (either reference or alternative).\n",

    "Study Design\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to enroll 189 patients, which was conducted from July 2013 to May 2016 in 20 study sites within the continental United States. The phase 1b portion of this study included 15 patients per group and compared the safety and immunogenicity among NDV-3, NDV-3A, and placebo groups. The phase 2a portion of the study was designed with 80% power to detect a difference in efficacy of NDV-3A and placebo, with α (2-sided) of 0.05, assuming a 50% attack rate (over 6 months) in placebo recipients, an estimated vaccine efficacy of 50%, and an expected early withdrawal rate of 25%. This design called for 87 patients each in the NDV-3A and placebo groups. The comparison provided a bridge to assure that NDV-3A safety and immunogenicity results can be linked back to those generated using NDV-3 in initial phase 1 studies.\n",

    "Enrolled patients provided informed consent and met all inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. In part, these criteria required patients be aged 18–55 years, using an approved method of birth control, and presenting with a clinically diagnosed active VVC episode at time of enrollment. An active VVC episode was defined as having a composite sign and symptom score [20] of ≥3 (range, 0–18), a vaginal swab culture-positive for C. albicans, and at least 2 episodes of vaginitis during the 12 months prior to the current episode, 1 of which was documented by a diagnostic test specific for Candida. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria and demographic data can be found in Supplementary Tables S1–S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrolled patients received 3 doses of oral fluconazole (150 mg each), taken on days −14, −11, and −8. At day 0, those with sign/symptom scores ≥3 were exited from the study and treated per the judgement of their physician. Those with combined sign/symptom scores <3 and who still met inclusion/exclusion criteria were randomized to a single intramuscular dose of either vaccine or placebo and were given 3 more doses of fluconazole (150 mg each), taken on days 0, 7, and 14 to allow near maximum immune response to the vaccine with minimal chance of influence of an active Candida colonization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrollees were scheduled for 7 office visits and allowed unlimited unscheduled visits to address questions or symptoms. At all visits enrollees underwent a complete history, including a review of adverse events and medications being taken, physical examination, symptom scores (by the patient), sign scores (by the investigator), mycological culture of vaginal swabs, and a cervicovaginal (CV) wash. Additionally, blood was collected for isolation of serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). All samples were stored at <−60oC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients who presented at office visits after day 17 (the 3 half-lives wash-out period for fluconazole) with symptom scores ≥3 were considered recurrent cases of VVC regardless of the culture result of their vaginal swab, treated with oral fluconazole (150 mg per day every 3 days for 3 doses), and continued in the study. A recurrence of VVC in vaccinated patients within 17 days of a previous episode was considered a failure of fluconazole therapy and not counted as a new episode of VVC.\n",

    "Immunological Assays\n",
    "\n",
    "Serum and CV wash samples were analyzed for anti-Als3 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), and PBMCs were evaluated for Als3-specific production of interferon γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin 17A (IL-17A) as previously described [19].\n",

    "Statistical Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical analyses of this study were consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines E9: Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials [21]. For each outcome, the proportion of patients in each group was summarized with point estimates and their 95% confidence interval (CI). The difference between the proportions and their 95% CIs were calculated for each outcome.\n",

    "Given no prior vaccine studies in this population, this study was defined as exploratory to identify potential endpoints for subsequent studies of the efficacy of NDV-3A in women with RVVC.\n",

    "This prospective study included 277 sexually active patients, aged between 18 and 50 years, who were referred to the Clinical Analysis and Research Laboratory of the State University of Maringá (UEM), Paraná, Brazil, from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The study was carried out with females who visited the laboratory to provide cervical-vaginal samples for clinical analyses, independently of the presence of VVC symptoms. Exclusion criteria were: hysterectomized, pregnant, or in post-partum condition; less than 14 years of age; some degree of difficulty in understanding the study; vaginal bleeding; sexual intercourse/vaginal douching within the 48 hours preceding the collection of the vaginal sample; those who reported receiving antibiotics, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs; and also those with a history of serious debilitating or immunosuppressant disease, including AIDS. All the women or parents gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. This research was approved by the Committee for Ethics in Research with Humans (COPEP) of Universidade Estadual de Maringá (UEM) (report no. 435/2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "After giving their consent, participants were asked to complete an enrollment questionnaire that included detailed questions regarding hypothesized risk factors of VVC (personal/sexual habits, history of VVC diagnoses during lifetime and the past year), presence of VVC signs and symptoms (vaginal discharge, vulvovaginal itching, vulvovaginal burning sensation, dysuria, and dyspareunia), and epidemiological data. Vaginal discharges were appraised by the health professional during sample collection [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaginal samples were collected with sterile swabs and a disposable vaginal speculum (Vagispec, Santa Catarina, Brazil), inoculated in sterile saline, and immediately seeded onto plates containing Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) (Difco, Detroit, Michigan, USA), supplemented with 50 mg/mL chloramphenicol (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Michigan, USA) and incubated at 25°C for up to five days. A pool of the colonies grown on each plate was subcultured on CHROMágar Candida (Probac, Paris, France) to ensure the purity of the isolates and to identify mixed cultures. Beginning with the pure culture, the yeasts were identified by classical phenotypic methods [10]. The yeasts were stored in Sabouraud dextrose broth (SDB) (Difco, Detroit, Michigan, USA) with 10% glycerol at -20°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "Women with a positive vaginal culture for yeasts were classified based on clinical profiles by physicians in three groups, as follows: 1) colonized (COL)- those without signs and symptoms of VVC; 2) with VVC- those with an acute episode, consisting of women who presented at least two signs or symptoms (discharge, itching, dysuria, and dyspareunia) but no previous episode within a 12-month period; 3) with RVVC- those presenting two or more symptoms in four or more episodes within a 12-month period [9]. Women with a negative vaginal culture were selected as the control group (CG).\n",
